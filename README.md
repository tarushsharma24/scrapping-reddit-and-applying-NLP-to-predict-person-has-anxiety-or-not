# scrapping-reddit-and-applying-NLP-to-predict-person-has-anxiety-or-not
I scrapped live data from reddit website from the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/ . i scrapped 500 posts from this link. since reddit loads further posts after scrolling to the end so i scrapped through its xml files which get generated after scrolling. This data was in raw form so i cleaned the data and stored them in sorted form in an excel file. i did data annotation for first 200 post in this excel file. i gave 1 if i felt like that person has anxiety and gave 0 if i don't think that person has anxiety. After this i performed NLP on these 200 posts and created a ML model using binomial naive bayes to predict if person has anxiety or not. i used this ML model to predict anxiety for the rest 300 posts that i scrapped. i used binomial naive bayes because on training set it gave a accuracy of 91%.
