It's just too hard to achieve them currently. So I gave myself anxiety when I was going into 9th grade, (5 years ago) just believed i had it so much that I developed a problem, and I've been fucked ever since. Except for about a 3 month streak where my parents made me fight through the anxiety, put me on a plane to England, (with my dad) and my anxiety just vanished once I was there. We got back a few days later and I felt great still, I even got a job for a couple months. Then covid started so I left the job, stayed at home, and now I'm useless again. It's a different type of anxiety from before my trip though. This anxiety stems almost entirely of a fear of throwing up in public. Before my trip, if I were to throw up in public, I would have been horrified, but that wasnt really a concern I had so it never happened. Now though, I basically can't go anywhere unless I've been there before, and I know where the bathrooms are. I took another trip recently to Calgary (where I want to move to and start a life in) hoping it would just click my brain back to how it was after England. It kind of did, it made me very motivated and excited to get my act together and work towards moving out there. But it didn't completely kill my fear of throwing up. On that trip, I couldnt get on the train, I had a breakdown as it was coming in because there was no way I would be caught throwing up on a train and getting weird looks from everybody. That's when I realized I need to fix this. When I got back home I tried researching it, all I got was agoraphobia stuff. I do believe it's partially agoraphobia, but the results weren't really accurate. The cycle of events is, I feel fine, I think about how I'm feeling fine and start to panic, when I got anxious I feel like I'm going to throw up, when I feel like I'm gonna throw up I get anxious, and so on and so on. I don't thinks it's just agoraphobia because I don't have a fear of it really if I'm at home, like obviously I don't like throwing up, but I know that if I have to, I can. But in public places or transport etc, I know I can't throw up there, which makes me need to throw up. I remember an incident before my trip to England where I was in my friend's car, we'd just had a huge buffet meal, and I ate way too much. This was before I was scared of throwing up really, but I ended up just barely making it out of her car and throwing up in the parking lot. This didn't really affect me as I knew I just ate too much. Then probably like a year later with no problems, I have this fear. That's the only incident I can remember that could've brought this on, but since I didn't get affected by it until much later when I'd pretty much forgotten about it, I don't know it that's it."}], "e": "par"}, {"c": [{"e": "text", "t": "Sorry I just kind of started rambling, I don't feel great right now and I just want to be like everyone else."}], "e": "par"}, {"c": [{"e": "text", "t": "Tldr: used to have anxiety, went on a trip, didn't have anxiety for 3 months at all, left my job and got a worse different kind of anxiety where I fall into a cycle of being anxious, making me feel like throwing up, which makes me very anxious that I'm going to throw up, etc. Don't think it's full blown agoraphobia since it's not the fear of throwing up as much as it is the fear of throwing up somewhere I'm not supposed to throw up.  (anywhere but a bathroom or my house basically) can't really go into public places unless I know where the bathrooms are, though I'm making some progress with short trips inside.
