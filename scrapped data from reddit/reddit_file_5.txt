I struggled with dark depression in my late teens/early twenties, so I have a huge amount of respect for mental health issues, but I've personally been in a stable place for several years. My always-on coping mechanism is to maintain a growth mindset and positive attitude. I have personally benefited from years of therapy, which has really developed my own empathy as well as making me an advocate for therapy for others. I'm comfortable being honest about what I want, saying what I mean, and apologising when I get things wrong. I sometimes look back at my diaries from that dark period as proof that things can change and it gives me hope. I just want to live a life where my girlfriend and I are happy together."}], "e": "par"}, {"c": [{"e": "text", "t": "She sometimes raises the subject of marriage and kids - I want both of those things, but I can't imagine building a home with this kind of instability.
