It\u2019s coming up a year since my fianc\u00e9 died, our son has just started nursery and Ive just gone back to work. SO many life changes, so it\u2019s really not surprising. I take 150mg pregabalin 3 times a day but lately I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s enough or working. I had a panic attack for the first time in a year last week. Since then, even taking my meds I\u2019ve just felt violently ill and on edge. My whole chest is heavy. My face is numb, like the right side of my face just feels droopy, though it isn\u2019t, it just feels it? My eye is blurry. I\u2019m pins and needle-y all over. My heart is pounding. I can\u2019t sleep, I feel sick, and dizzy. You know when you\u2019ve had a panic attack and you\u2019re in that fight or flight state and just feel like general shit for an hour or so? I feel like that. But it\u2019s been days now. It\u2019s worse at night. I thought about going to the doctor but I don\u2019t know if they can help as I\u2019m already on meds, and I\u2019ve found in the past as soon as you mention \u2018anxiety\u2019 they don\u2019t take you seriously or think you\u2019re a hypochondriac. I am sure I am just stressed at the minute, and it will pass. But can heightened anxiety REALLY make you feel this awful? I\u2019ve felt so \u2018normal\u2019 for so long I\u2019ve forgotten the physical affect it can have on you. I panicked myself into another panic attack (lol) earlier because my brain was convinced it absolutely couldn\u2019t JUST be anxiety and I was having a stroke, so that was a laugh.

I woke up and began questioning where is everyone? At school the classrooms felt empty as it felt that daily someone would go missing. Aside from my dogs and cat no one was at home. I even played some games online and that even felt empty. I felt alone, but my mind was the strangest of all that. It was harder to put together thoughts, and make images in my head. It felt like I couldn't think straight no matter how hard I tried. Thus has been going on for days now and I'm lost on what do. I only recently decided to look it up and found that it may be brain fog.
