So I work at a pharmacy. A very busy, very understaffed corporate pharmacy. So after the pandemic things really got out of hand, we can't keep up with your prescription count anymore, on top of all our daily tasks as technicians. We also have a verbally abusive pharmacist who \"can do no wrong\" because if he gets fired corporate will have to close our pharmacy due to having no other \"manager\" (He doesn't actually hold the title of manager) That we need to legally operate. We might have 3 techs on a good day. Usually only 2. We have a drive through and front counter so that's where we're stuck as the pharmacist tries to force one person to work both to touch the mountain of filling scripts but due to our customer count it's not feasible. We never slow down. And customers are extremely rude and not understanding. I've been cursed at, screamed at, belittled, etc. All for stuff I can't control. Best I can do is get your stuff ready now you're here. Yes I know you dropped it off yesterday but it is what it is. So now we're drowning in customer complaints all while the district manager sends emails demanding we address them, demanding we do these tasks despite you know, two people. Demanding better customer service, etc. I have panic attacks badly, but can't even step out to take a moment to calm down and breathe. Instead I just help customers with shaky hands and tears running down my face. I've applied to at least five other places to get a job, but they haven't gotten back. I'm at my wits end. My life is consumed by the anxiety of work, the dread of having to go back, I worry constantly about work. I've saved up a good bit of money, but I'm hesitant to quit and have to dip into it until I can get another job, but I don't seem to have a choice. What should I do?
